      <p>Nature has an incredible way of offering respite from the daily stresses that plague us. “Up here, my problems disappear when I can just be in nature tending to the vines,” Megan Bell says, “except my problems haven’t gone away.”</p>

<p>It’s an early Tuesday morning in late September. My friends and I drive through the backroads of the Santa Cruz Mountains canopied by soaring redwoods that still glisten from early morning dew.</p>

<p>The forest feels peaceful, a stark contrast from the traffic congestion we’ve escaped on the CA-17N as people from Santa Cruz head to work in the South Bay.</p>

<p>We spot a few deer as we make our way up to the Makjavich vineyard, where Megan has been farming with the vineyard’s owner, Larry Makjavich. Today she is harvesting Pinot Noir, and we’ve come to help.</p>

<p>Megan arrives at the vineyard shortly after 8 am with a small group of volunteers, comprised of friends and a visiting cousin from North Carolina. The winemaker is warm and welcoming, almost zen-like. Her smile is so genuine it’s infectious. Nobody suspects that this will be a long day for her.</p>

<p>After we’ve harvested all the Pinot Noir, Megan will drive her pickup truck 30 miles to her winemaking co-op facility where she’ll shovel 1.6 tons of grapes into the de-stemmer and start pressing them immediately. Later she tells me that she finished her day around 9 pm that night.</p>

<p>As the sole proprietor of Margin Wines, Megan does it all (with the occasional help from friends and family). Some days she will drive three hours to tend to her grapes. Once she camped at Mesa del Sol in Arroyo Seco with owner Ann Hougham before harvesting grapes early the next morning.These are only a few examples of the many challenges to being a small producer. </p>

<p>“A little green is fine,” she says as she explains to us how to select and harvest the grapes. She’s afraid the Pinot might be too ripe.  Rising temperatures over the weekend, followed by light rain on Monday, meant that the Pinot had to be picked today.</p>

<p>Megan laughs when she recounts how she stumbled into winemaking. “My high school boyfriend and I were brewing beer at the time. We had this crazy idea that we would open a brewery-winery. He was going to take care of the brewing part, so I had to go to school to learn how to make wine.” And she did.</p>

<p>In 2012, she graduated from UC Davis with a degree in Viticulture and Enology. “Obviously, we are no longer together.” She rolls her eyes. The two separated before Megan finished her degree. But she persevered and went on to apprentice in wineries in California, Oregon, New Zealand, and France before returning home.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Women are judged on their performance. Men are judged on their potential.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unbeknownst to Megan, perseverance is probably one of her greatest strengths. Starting a winemaking business where real estate and cost of living is among the most expensive in the US isn’t easy. And less so as a woman in her twenties trying to make headway in the industry. In her words, it was a very shitty time.</p>

<p>“Women are judged on their performance. Men are judged on their potential.” This is a quote that Megan says has resonated strongly with her. She describes how she’s had to prove herself in order to have the same opportunities as her male counterparts, who’ve been either less experienced or knowledgeable than her.  Work always seemed to be a sprint to get things done and then move on to the next thing.</p>

<p>Something shifted though when she spent some time in France. There she discovered that winemaking could be a lifestyle, not just a job. She learned that wine could be made differently from what was taught at school. She saw that you didn’t have to rush all the time.</p>

<p>Megan also fell in love with Chenin Blanc. Soon, she wanted to come home to the US to make wine from underrepresented regions, vineyards and grape varietals.  Influenced by winemaking techniques in the Loire Valley, one of the current hotspots for natural wine, she wanted to work with organic fruit.</p>

<p>Finding work back home in the Santa Cruz Mountains proved to be challenging. After working many short-term gigs, she finally landed a stable job working as an assistant winemaker at Beauregard Vineyards in 2015.</p>

<p>“I would do it differently if I had to do it again,” Megan says as we work side by side. In hindsight, the Sierra Foothills would have been cheaper and perhaps an easier location to accomplish her goals.</p>

<p>The sun beats strongly onto the vineyard by nine o’clock. My gloves and pruning shears are sticky with grape juice. Yellowjackets hover over our buckets of grapes, eager to get some breakfast.</p>

<p>After working for a year at Beauregard Vineyards, she obtained permission to use their leftover grapes and started producing wine under the name Margin Wines. In December 2017, Megan left Beauregard when her wine production became a full-time job. And the rest is history.</p>

<p>Well, not exactly.</p>

<p>If Megan’s perseverance is impressive, so is her candidness. She never complains, but won’t gloss over the challenges she’s had to face either.
 
Finding farmers willing to sell their grapes to a young female winemaker was more difficult than she had anticipated. “People were skeptical, they wanted to know how I would be able to pay them,” she recounts.</p>

<figure class="uk-align-right@s uk-width-1-2@s">

</figure>

<p>Finding organic fruit was even harder. So Megan began working with small farmers, accompanying them through the transition to organic agriculture if they chose to do so.</p>

<p>“I will work with them for one vintage and give them about 6 months to decide [if they want to transition to organic farming] after that. In the end, if they choose not to, that’s fine. We go our separate ways. I can’t really dictate what people do.”</p>

<p>Today, Megan sources seven different varietals, including Barbera and Chenin Blanc, from six vineyards across the Santa Cruz Mountains and Central Coast. Out of the six, three were already organic when she began working with them.</p>

<p>The others have started transitioning towards organic farming under Megan’s guidance, although one had initially decided that organic wasn’t for them. “I was sad because I really liked working with their grapes. Then they called back six months later saying they were going to transition and wanted to work together again.”</p>

<p>Inexperienced volunteers begin to retreat to the shade as the morning progresses. Some have left to go to work. The more seasoned harvesters such as retired vineyard owner Larry Makjavich, and Soaring Heart, the youthful seventy-something hippie neighbor, continue to pick grapes unfazed by the beating sun.</p>

<figure class="uk-align-left@s uk-width-1-2@s">

<p>For a hobby vineyard owner like Larry, Megan is a godsend. “It’s great to have someone tend the vines with me. And it’s nice to get some money for my grapes afterward.”</p>

<p>Money is something that is on Megan’s mind these days. She wonders where she’ll find enough to pay the rent and feed herself, despite having created a detailed budget at the beginning of the year.</p>

<p>“I have money in the business. But if I take it out to pay myself something, I won’t have any left to buy bottles.” Unforeseeable expenses have recently derailed her financial planning.</p>

<p>“It’s not that my business isn’t doing well,” she continues. “I sell out a week after my wines are released.” But for her business to be viable, Megan estimates that she needs to produce at least 2,500 cases. This year she’s trying to double her 2018 production from 575 to 1,050 cases. As with any small business, scaling is hard with limited resources.</p>

<p>Harvest is the busiest time of the year for wine producers. The work and financial stresses appear to be catching up with Megan.  She changes the subject as we reach the final rows of vines. “How did you get into wine?” she asks.</p>

<p>I tell her it was when I saw how wine could create magical connections between people, time, and places.</p>

<p>“Wine used to be like that for me,” she says. “Now, I don’t know…”</p>

<div align="center">***</div>

<p>A few weeks later, I meet up with Megan again at the Makjavich Vineyard. This time to pick Merlot. She welcomes me with her infectious smile and a hug. It’s her last harvest of the season.</p>

<p>Megan’s been working nonstop since the end of summer. “I have a week to get all of this pressed and into barrels before going to New York,” she explains, excited that the season is finally slowing down.</p>

<p>Her timeline is short because she’s off to pour her wines at the New York and Los Angeles editions of Raw, one of the world’s largest traveling natural wine festivals.</p>

<p>I know she had a meeting at the Santa Cruz County’s Small Business Development Center at Cabrillo College. I ask how it went. “I’m working with an advisor now. He’s helped me look at new types of financing. I’ve started going to meetups. I’m going to look for investors.”</p>

<p>This business advisor has looked at her numbers and thinks Margin Wines’ profits can grow by at least 500 percent in the coming year. Her fall sales were a success; she rapidly sold out again after releasing her bottles.</p>

<p>Sales to direct customers have also increased. “Right now, 40 percent of my sales are direct sales. One day I hope to reach 100 percent. People only need to sign up for the mailing list.”</p>

<p>Megan seems more optimistic than when I last saw her. “I was also able to get some food stamps,” she adds, a weight lifted off her shoulders.</p>

<p>“There was a time when I didn’t think I’d make it,” Megan admits. I ask if this was before or after we had met a few weeks earlier. “I’d say I was right in the middle of it then,” she replies.</p>
