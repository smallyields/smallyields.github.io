      <p>One reason why we love small producers is that they are often passionate about working in harmony with nature.  By using fewer pesticides in the vines and fewer chemical additives in the bottle, these winemakers are readopting old wine techniques that are better for our bodies and the environment.</p>

<p>Those who abide rigorously by this rule are joining the slow-growing movement of natural wines.</p>

<p>Alice Feiring is a writer and champion of these wines. She has written numerous books and is the founder of The Feiring Line, a comprehensive newsletter and database about natural wines.</p>

<p>We talked to her about the current state and future of natural wines, and how to identify a good bottle.</p>

<p>This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and cohesiveness.</p>

<p><strong>How did you first get into natural wines?</strong></p>

<p><strong>AF:</strong> At the time, I was writing about wine in general and was writing a book for Food and Wine Magazine, doing a lot of tastings for a guide book. I realized that I hated most of the wines I was tasting, while also noticing some parts of the world were producing wines I really liked.</p>

<p>I did a lot of research to find out what were in those wines as opposed to the other ones I disliked. It seemed that the wines were getting bigger and bigger. I thought the problem was just new oak, but at that point, I started researching wine technology to see what you could do to force a wine into a certain taste profile.</p>

<p>I became aware that I had self-selected natural wines. We didn’t call it natural wines then, but now that I knew what I liked to drink, it’s what I kept studying and writing about.</p>

<p><strong>You recently published a new book called Natural Wine for the People. Tell us more.</strong></p>

<p><strong>AF:</strong> I think the time was right for a book on natural wines. It was also my first illustrated book, and it was kind of fun to write.</p>

<p><strong>For many people who aren’t familiar with natural wine, there are various terms associated with it: organic, sustainable, low intervention, biodynamic, natural, etc.  These terms don’t always mean the same things, and it can be confusing sometimes as a consumer. How would you suggest to someone how to choose a bottle?</strong></p>

<p><strong>AF:</strong> This is a very complicated question because we are in an era where the old rules do not apply as far as good wine goes. I think that for somebody who is starting out, they need to find a wine that they like.</p>

<p>If you are coming from a classically trained background in wine, you basically have to throw everything you thought was true out the window; understand that hard cider flavors, some heightened VA [volatile acidity], all of that is acceptable as long as the wine has energy and balance when you have it in your mouth.</p>

<p>Allow people to suspend everything they know about wine and just let them find something that they like, without looking for flaws. That’s how I would encourage people who are schooled in wine to look at natural wines.</p>

<p>Also, not every natural wine has those qualities. There are some natural wines that I could put in front of you, and you would think it’s a beautiful wine without it being weird at all. Within natural wines, there’s a  broader range of flavors, textures, and experiences, thereby making it very difficult to categorize.</p>

<p>Most people don’t know what a native yeast Sauvignon Blanc tastes like without any sulfur added to it. It’s going to taste and act very differently than a yeasted and highly sulfured Sauvignon Blanc.</p>

<p>The only thing I can say is to keep an open mind. Forget everything you thought you knew about wine,  if you don’t like it go on to the next one. But like any wine, find out why you like it, and then ask the right questions. It’s super hard, but keep tasting till you find what you like.</p>

<p>I will also say there is a lot of what I consider to be flawed wines on the market that I won’t drink.  Just because it’s natural doesn’t mean it’s good. And if anybody tells you that, they’re assholes.</p>

<p><strong>Would you agree then that natural wine is ultimately much more than a technique, that it’s also a philosophy?</strong></p>

<p><strong>AF:</strong> Yes, it is a philosophy.  It is not a technique; it’s not a style. It’s just winemaking without tricks.</p>

<p><strong>Is that how you would summarize this philosophy?</strong></p>

<p><strong>AF:</strong> You know, in Natural Wine for the People, I say it’s wine without crap in it. Yes, wine without tricks. But winemakers also need skill and need talent, like anything. Wine doesn’t make itself.</p>

<p>I usually think it’s like paper bag dramatics. Inside the paper bag for winemakers, you’ve got a great bunch [of grapes], and you have your choice of vessels to put it in. Those are the tools you’re working with, and you try to do the best possible with that.</p>

<p><strong>I’ve met people who don’t want to label their wines as biodynamic or organic for various reasons. They don’t necessarily want to get certified. How do you go about identifying those bottles if it’s not on the label?</strong></p>

<p><strong>AF:</strong> It has to do with farming. There are certain parts of the world where it’s very important to label the wine organic because the label is a statement. For example, in places like Champagne and Bordeaux, it’s important to label your wine organic;  there’s so much there that is not.</p>

<p>But yes, a lot of people don’t want to because they don’t want to deal with the paperwork. It used to be because they didn’t want to deal with the stigma attached to being organic, but that’s gone now. So it’s more about not wanting to put up with the government.</p>

<p>What can I say, it’s hard for the consumer who is looking for organic wine.  The sommelier and wine shop vendors will mostly know if a wine is organic. That’s why it’s important to get your stuff from people you trust, and who get it.</p>

<p><strong>In your book, The Dirty Guide to Wine, you present eight criteria for judging a wine: its emotional impact, liveliness, evolution in the glass, balance, drinkability, savory quality, transparency, and sense of place.</strong></p>

<p><strong>It struck a chord with me, and  I wondered if wine would be less intimidating if approached in this way by more people. How did you come up with these criteria, and why do you think they’re so important?</strong></p>

<p><strong>AF:</strong> I believe I mentioned in the book the reasons I did this. I figured it was important, so I republished them in my new book [Natural Wine for the People]. I wanted to emphasize them. I  think they are tasting categories that anyone can relate to so people can understand why they like wine, what is important to them.</p>

<p>I was asked to judge a wine contest in Italy called Wine Without Walls. I said yes, I would do it, but I wasn’t going to judge by a points system.  I wanted to devise my own system.  I did it quickly, trying to decide what elements were most important to wine. I jotted these down and probably jotted a few others that I later discounted.</p>

<p>The first thing is an emotional response. It doesn’t mean that if you don’t have an emotional response, it’s not a great wine. But I realized that if you had six of these qualities — any six of those qualities — then you had something really interesting. If it had maybe four or five, then it’s an ok wine. If you have any less, then you will have something that is out of balance.</p>

<p>It came from examining what resonated with me, that’s all. I sat on it for a while and thought, do I want to change anything?  I realized that I didn’t. Still, when I get lost sometimes — even I get lost— I go back to them to help me refocus. It’s almost like it refocuses me on what is relevant.</p>

<p><strong>A while back on Instagram, you posted about how certain natural wines were becoming harder and harder to come by in New York City. Natural wines are usually produced by small winemakers and in limited quantities. Is there a risk that the demand for these wines will drive prices up or create a cult following like we’ve seen in Burgundy or Bordeaux, for example?</strong></p>

<p><strong>AF:</strong> As more people drink natural wines, the best natural wines will become scarcer and scarcer. Without a doubt, we’re in that situation right now. Everybody is complaining that wines that were not previously allocated are now allocated.</p>

<p>What to do about that? Certain wines are made in small quantities. There’s nothing we can do about that except hope that more people start making natural wine.  It’s just the way it is. Prices will go up, especially with the tariffs. Just because prices are going up, doesn’t mean they’re going up at the source, for the winemaker. The ex-cellar price stays pretty constant.</p>

<p>For example, if you go to some of the most coveted wines like if you go to Pierre Overnoy, he will be very upset that his wines go for so much money because he’ll still sell out of his store. It has gone up, of course. I think it’s maybe 17 Euros, which is expensive, but it’s not what it’s gotten on the market. If anybody could buy a bottle of Overnoy for 17 Euros, are you kidding me?!</p>

<p>So we do have our DRCs (Domaine de la Romanée-Conti), we do have our more highfalutin wines. But luckily a lot of people are making wines for every day, and probably will continue. As we get more natural wines from places like Argentina, Chile, Australia, and the United States, we’ll hopefully get enough for everybody.</p>

<p><strong>Do you think we’ll see people being encouraged to drink more locally in the future to support local winemakers that have small productions?</strong></p>

<p><strong>AF:</strong> That’s problematic because it’s only recently you could get a natural wine from California. What do you do? I’m not going to drink a local wine that’s fucked up just because it’s local. Now thank goodness there are more things we can drink from California and even here in New York State. So as the wines get better, people will be drinking more locally.</p>

<p>Still, for a lot of us, except in rare instances, the European wines do have a certain superiority. I suppose I shouldn’t even say something like that because I will be tarred and feathered.</p>

<p>I think it’s safe to say though that, as more people work naturally and the quality gets better, we’ll all be happy to reach for local wines. And that’s already started.</p>

<p>Another problem is that it’s still cheaper to buy from Europe. If I go to the store now, I can get a beautiful wine from France between 14 and 18 dollars. It’s really hard to do that domestically, even impossible. I can’t think of one 18 dollar wine I can get that is good.</p>

<p><strong>How do you see the future for natural wines?</strong></p>

<p><strong>AF:</strong> We’re going to have warriors of natural wine; winemaking will keep getting better and better. I do believe it will just be known as wine. I think the natural part will be secondary. To make a great wine it will be necessary to meet the basic requirements of natural wines.</p>

<p><strong>Are you concerned about the environmental impact of wine, or how global climate change is affecting winemaking?</strong></p>

<p><strong>AF:</strong> Well, there are two aspects of the environmental impact of wine that worry me. One being, the things that are polluting our environment; pesticides, herbicides, and irrigation aren’t necessary. I do not like the idea of large-scale farming. I think it’s bad for the environment.</p>

<p>And yes, conversely, I am concerned about climate change and its impact. However, the vine is a very adaptive plant. With a careful farmer who looks at the vine and looks at the environment, we can succeed and be able to have wine in the future.</p>

<p>But if someone is willfully relying on irrigation and somebody’s willfully planting Cabernet and Pinot where there’s no business to do so, well good luck to them.</p>

<p><strong>One example where we saw climate change have an impact was in the South of France this summer.  Winegrowers lost their crops in the Languedoc due to multiple heatwaves.</strong></p>

<p><strong>AF:</strong> Yes, they lost a lot of crops. Climate change indeed hits the unpredictability and instability of the weather.</p>

<p><strong>Do you think winemakers will have to adapt?</strong></p>

<p><strong>AF:</strong> Yes, but how? Some people are already changing. Those who did not pull leaves, who did not have exposed grapes survived better.</p>

<p>That’s going to change: people’s ideas about leaf pulling in certain areas. Better to have a few underripe grapes than to lose your grapes. People are changing the way they are pruning to adapt to climate change. So that’s what I meant by the attentive farmers. Those who are not doing what they have always done, but are realizing that they have to change.</p>
