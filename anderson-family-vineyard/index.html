      <p>There are no signs when you arrive at 20120 NE Harrington Lane in Newberg, Oregon. This part of the Dundee Hills AVA is more a patchwork of hazelnut trees and small farmlands than dense rows of vineyards.</p>

<p>My excitement mounts as my partner in crime pulls out his phone and starts punching the code into the keypad of the gated property. Some of the best wines I’ve ever tasting were at inconspicuous wineries such as this one. No signs are always a good sign. It means that people are spending more time producing astounding bottles instead of astonishing marketing. As the saying goes, good wine needs no bush.</p>

<p>We had only heard about the Anderson Family Vineyard a few days earlier while having brunch at the bar of a Portland restaurant. Seated beside me was a fellow Canadian who worked in the restaurant business and enjoyed wine as much as we did.</p>

<p>Together, we traded Portland restaurant and bar names like baseball cards. We reminisced about past wine trips we had taken, and lamented over-restrictive Canadian import laws.</p>

<p>Josie was ending her trip just as ours was about to begin.  We asked for a few winery recommendations since we were heading towards the Willamette Valley, Oregon’s top wine destination.</p>

<p>She raved about visiting the Anderson Family Vineyard, which is situated less than an hour south of Portland. Allison (Anderson) had spent over an hour showing her the property and pouring a generous vertical tasting of their best bottles. “Just make sure to book an appointment,” she said.</p>

<p>These are the sorts of winery visits we enjoy most; it’s an intimate way to discover new wines and the people who make them.</p>

<p>We request an appointment through their website as soon as we arrive at Dundee, our home base during our Willamette Valley visit. With luck, we immediately receive a response saying that they are happy to welcome us at 11 am the following day.</p>

<p>As we pass through  the gates and drive up the gravel road to the winery, I can’t help but admire the view of the gentle slopes hugging the property. The place seems empty except for two cars parked near a small warehouse several hundred yards away from the tasting room.</p>

<p>We are greeted upon arrival by a laid back fellow named Blake, who informs us that the owners, Cliff and Allison Anderson, are on vacation. Adopted into the family just over a year ago, Blake Talbot is a self-professed fermentation geek and is the house winemaker.</p>

<p>The first thing he asks is if we want to check out the vineyard. I can barely contain my excitement; I already know that this visit will be memorable.</p>

<p>And the next ninety minutes are just that, as Blake patiently answers all of our questions and talks about the vineyard, its history, soil, and his specialty, the winemaking process.</p>

<p>The vineyard sits on an ancient landslide of broken basalt and is among one of the first to be planted in the area. Much like Mount Etna in Sicily or the Canary Islands in Spain, vines here grow on iron-rich volcanic soil.</p>

<p>“See those fist-sized rocks,” Blake points to a row of large stones that line the top of the hill. “Those are broken pieces of hardened lava made of volcanic deposit. They all come from this property.”</p>

<p>The winery’s slopes and basalt soil mean that rain quickly drains to the bottom of the hills, forcing  the vines to stretch their roots in search of water deep beneath the soil. As a result, the plants produce fruit with intense and complex flavors.</p>

<p>The Andersons specifically had this in mind when they bought the land in the eighties. Cliff Anderson was actually on the committee that helped form the Dundee Hills AVA. Today their vines, which are organic and dry-farmed, are almost thirty years old. The only varietals you’ll find here are Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, with a few rows of Pinot Gris planted by mistake several years ago.</p>

<p>Neighboring winemakers are eager to get their hands on the Andersons’ grapes because these mature vines produce some of the best fruit in the Dundee Hills. Over the years, wineries such as White Rose,Bergstrom, JK Carriere, de Lancelotti and others, have sourced their grapes from this vineyard. New producers are always adding their names to the list.</p>

<figure class="uk-align-right@s uk-width-1-2@s">
    <img src="http://smallyields.github.io/uploads/img/sm-blake-talbot.jpg" alt="winemaker" />
    <figcaption>Blake Talbot, winemaker.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Blake attributes three main factors to their quality wine: the location and soil of the vineyard, their ability to afford smaller yields of better fruit, and their vineyard manager.</p>

<p>“Rudy [Chavez] helped plant the first vines on our site 28 years ago. He’s been farming for over 40 years and has seen it all. Thanks to him, we can deal with almost anything.”</p>

<p>There are numerous components to take into consideration when making wine. Many of these are out of your control: weather, disease, natural disasters, pests, and the list goes on. But these things don’t seem to faze Blake. Over the years he’s gleaned wisdom through trial and error, and has been fortunate to surround himself with highly experienced people in the field.</p>

<p>In his previous role as assistant winemaker at an industrial winery, Blake would oversee the blending of some 25 different types of wines, many of them for custom crush clients. This meant working with no less than 12 different grape varietals and producing everything from sparkling to still to port-style wines. It’s no wonder that making small-batch bottlings of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay at the Anderson Family Vineyard seems easy by comparison. “There’s no need to be stressed,” he says, “especially when you’re working with great fruit.”</p>

<p>It’s time to taste some wines. Blake leads us through the tasting room, which also acts as a warehouse where the wine completes its primary fermentation. Off to one side is a row of oak barrels full of Chardonnay, which Blake had brought up to warm from the cold underground cellar late this past spring.</p>

<figure class="uk-align-left@s uk-width-1-2@s">
    <img src="http://smallyields.github.io/uploads/img/sm-anderson-barrels.jpg" alt="Wine barrels" />
    <figcaption>Barrels of Chardonnay.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Come and listen to this,” Blake says gleefully while removing the bunghole cork on the side of one of the oak barrels. I press my ear against the wood’s hole and hear a symphony of sputter and fizzle. He smiles as I look up in astonishment. The wine is singing.</p>

<p>Blake explains that he uses spontaneous fermentation as much as possible in his winemaking process. This means using whatever yeast is found naturally in the air to ferment the grape must.  For him, this type of fermentation is beneficial in creating a distinctive style and quality of wine all thanks to the unique house blend of yeast found onsite. “Having the wines ferment slower is a benefit which gives us a textural component we like.”</p>

<p>While admitting that spontaneous fermentation is riskier and that yeast inoculation may be necessary at times, Blake still prefers adopting the more natural technique. “I enjoy managing those risks. Hopefully, I’ll have added a little something extra [by taking those risks], making the wine that much better.”</p>

<p>Blake begins to pour a lineup of Pinot Gris, Chardonnay, and Pinot Noir vintages. Josie was right; the vertical tasting at Anderson Family Vineyard is generous and elaborate.</p>

<p>This type of experience allows you to compare and contrast their wines, which all have great structure and highlight their aging potential. The Pinot Noirs are like sisters, each showcasing unique traits despite their refined family attributes shining through. But I can’t help being partial to the 2011 Chardonnay, harvested late that October.</p>

<p>“It was a particularly cool and rainy year,” Blake explains. “This vintage is quite lean and austere compared to some of our warmer vintages.” Initially, it wasn’t a favorite among customers. But this wine has aged with grace and elegance, bringing me the same joy I get from sipping a Pouilly-Fuissé.</p>

<p>If you’ve happened to hear about the Anderson Family Vineyard, you will know that it’s almost impossible to find their wines anywhere. They do not sell them outside of the winery except for some bottles at a couple of restaurants and at the Valley Wine Merchants shop, all in nearby Newberg. </p>

<p>They also do not submit their wines for review. Cliff Anderson has no interest in them. “There was a regional tasting once where all of the local wineries were pouring their wines. At the end of the night, the only empty bottle was the Anderson’s,” Blake recounts laughing. “Cliff said that was all the rankings he needed.”</p>

<p>As an up-and-coming winemaker,  it is normal that Blake would like his wines reviewed one day. But so far, the vineyard does just fine without them. With over 600 wine club members — some loyal till the end of their lives, says Blake— and nearby winemakers eager to buy their fruit, the winery is thriving.</p>

<p>“It’s all thanks to word of mouth,” says the winemaker. And it’s true, that’s how we stumbled upon this gem in the first place.</p>
