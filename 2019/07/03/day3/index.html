I have five hundred words. A baby chapterâ€¦which took me two days to write and still needs editing.</p><p>They say you have to show up to the page. Every. Day. I missed yesterdayâ€™s USA-ENG womenâ€™s quarter-final game for this. Iâ€™m missing the other quarter-final game today. All that so that I can show up to the page. And produce a sentence per hour.</p><p>Writing is freakinâ€™ hard. That self-righteous Millenial Medium blogger was probably right: I have nothing worthy to say. Iâ€™m just trying not to be an online polluter. The Internet is already so gross and dirty. I donâ€™t want to add to the plethora of bad writing out there and create more word pollution.</p><p>I got hungry, so I grabbed the closest resemblance to junk food I could find in my kitchen: Trader Joeâ€™s unsweetened coconut chips. Yesterday, I finished the candied ginger hiding at the back of my cupboard. It was a bit stale but edible. The day before that, I chewed through an old pack of gum I found at the bottom of my purse. There was a faded receipt stuck to the last piece. It tasted like expired mint chapstick. Am I the only one who needs to snack while she writes? DÃ©jÃ  vu, Iâ€™m reliving my freshman year. Iâ€™ve tried offsetting the munchies with tea, water, iced coffee. I could start day drinking. That was a thing writers did before, right? Although it would make me sleepy. I could scrounge for the peanut butter jar. Wait. I havenâ€™t kept any in the house for years, not since the overdose incident in my senior year. Itâ€™s all coming back to me now.</p><p>Shit, Iâ€™ve been sitting here for hours?! I didnâ€™t realize that Iâ€™ve skipped lunch. (The coconut chip craving is starting to make sense). Can I call it a day now? I need to go to the grocery store and get me some fuel. Iâ€™m going to get fat on writing. Oh look, I surpassed this weekâ€™s daily word count record. By twenty-seven words. Todayâ€™s word count: 359</p></div></div></div><div class="section-padding--none"><div class="grid"><hr class="sep"/></div></div><div class="section-padding"><div class="grid-small"> <span class="post__author">Posted by Small Yields</span></div></div></article></div><section class="related section-padding"><div class="grid-xlarge"><h2 class="related__title">Related</h2><div class="related__container"><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/2019/07/03/day3/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/placeholder-15.jpg" alt="Day 3"/></figure><div><h2 class="related__text">Day 3</h2></div></a></article></div></div></section></main><footer class="footer section-padding"><div class="grid"><div class="subscribe" id="subscribe"><div class="subscribe__container"> <span class="subscribe__title">Subscribe</span><p class="subscribe__text">Get a weekly email of posts Iâ€™ve added to the site.</p><form method="POST" action="&amp;c=?" id="mc-signup" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" novalidate><div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px;" aria-hidden="true"> <input type="text" name="" tabindex="-1" value=""></div><div class="form-group"> <input id="mce-EMAIL" type="email" name="EMAIL" placeholder="Email Address"></div><div class="form__btn"> <input id="mc-submit" type="submit" value="Sign Up" name="subscribe"></div></form><p class="subscribe__error hidden"></p></div></div><hr class="sep--white"/><div class="footer__container"><ul class="footer__tags"><li><a class="footer__link" href="/tag/indie-wines">Indie Wines</a></li><li><a class="footer__link" href="/tag/reading-list">Reading List</a></li><li><a class="footer__link" href="/tag/kale">Kale</a></li><li><a class="footer__link" href="/tag/the-writers-life">The Writer's Life</a></li></ul><ul class="footer__social"></ul><p class="footer__tags">Copyright (c) 2019 SmallYields</p></div></div></footer><section class="contact popup"><div class="popup__close"><div class="popup__exit"></div></div><div class="contact__container popup__container"><div class="contact__img"><figure class="absolute-bg" style="background-image: url();"></figure></div><div class="contact__content"><div class="contact__mast section-padding--half"><div class="grid"><h2>Contact</h2></div></div><div class="section-padding--none"><hr class="sep"/></div><div class="contact__form section-padding--half"><div class="grid-xlarge"> <form id="form" class="form" action="" method="POST"><div class="form__subcontainer"><div> <label for="form-first-name">First Name</label> <input type="text" name="first-name" id="form-first-name" required></div><div> <label for="form-last-name">Last Name</label> <input type="text" name="last-name" id="form-last-name" required></div></div><div> <label for="form-email">E-Mail</label> <input type="email" name="email" id="form-email" required></div><div> <label for="form-message">Message</label> <textarea name="message" id="form-message" rows="3"></textarea></div><div class="form__submit"><div class="form__btn"> <input type="submit" value="Send"></div></div><p class="form__message"></p></form></div></div></div></div></section><script src="/assets/js/app.min.js"></script></body></html>
